#jQuery Bookmarklet

##Introduction

A simple jQuery bookmarklet that I hope will help others looking to develop a flexible bookmarklet on pages that may not have jQuery loaded on them already.

##Setup

The bookmarklet executes JavaScript that dynamically includes a `<script />` tag in the document.  That script will ensure that jQuery is loaded and enable the bookmarklet to execute script that relies on jQuery.
